portrait honor dishonor men represent ala constantly unfairly get compared braveheart two entirely different film probably similar fact scot historical scotland yet comparison frequently bother seems almost assumed braveheart better film rob roy like braveheart lot idea comparing rob roy little insulting put quite simply love braveheart pale shadow much love rob roy particular reason rob roy real people let face william wallace braveheart real person he legend martyr larger life figurehead depiction also perfect person never wrong basically showing scot countryman promised land finally fail fault like jesus betrayed people trusted even go worst kind torture want freedom much depiction wallace well done effective really doesnt inspire intrigue find human ambiguity far facinating human perfection last temptation christ better film king king also one reason think rob roy better braveheart rob roy may heroic brave far perfect make several mistake affected life many loved one sure bearing false claim duke argyll act nobility courage also act egoism self centeredness let forget kinfolk claimed protect driven homeless end film act rob best could could ask robs wife mary also normal ambigious person let start though look film sure shes beautiful doesnt wear makeup basically allows natural beauty show compare two love one depending point view william wallace braveheart two lady hot hardly indicitive woman looked time especially lay person maybe fair comparison another example rob roys attempt accuracy far effective throughout rob roy mary live vicious rape dastardly carrion cunningham feel compelled tell rob struggle doesnt know rob must seek revenge rape revenge would surely mean death rob mary prepared sacrifice villain rob roy equally compelling although enemy braveheart well written hardly original robert bruce man brave cowardly plagued moral decision familar fictional realm take claim king scotland betray wallace order ensure safety family name bruce ambigious character braveheart brutus julius ceasar fredo godfather part type character hardly original longshanks although compelling villain right one dimensional epidemy evil tyrant way stand direct contrast wallace heroism rob roy three villain wonderful chicanery first let start marquis montrose man obsessed self image he willing let innocent man suffer see mocked favorite word factor man obsessed power upset man great noble bearing duke argyll considered greater providency shamefully self obsessed insecure evil aristocrat way make unique cunningham callarn conspirator rob roy also roys direct assailant callarn cunning cowardace almost comical anything maintain good marquis includes backstabbing trickery cunningham compelling character seems raised whatever obtain status affection marquis need father little know marquis real father therefore opportunity obtain wealth come callarn grab without even questioning much like evil modern man self centered vain care consequence action others many criticized tim roth performance film overacting hogwash say clear cunningham simply evil also psychopath throughout film world man stepson around shooting random people amusement cunningham much unbelievable character live society people seem decreased value human life rob roy simply teach circumstance decreased value changed problem throughout human history vanity human heart allow capacity compassion rob roy mary give hope goodness prevail snake always exist world another character find fascinating duke argyll true nobleman value honesty courtesy direct contrast marquis appreciates bravery rob roy mary direct vexation marquis factor give world hope people power hopefully people like marquis exception rule final duel rob roy exciting battle scene braveheart one thing get tired people telling braveheart better film battle scene first battle scene hardly original spartacus gladiator hollywood long tradition historical european battle scene braveheart best battle scene ever put film suffer one important problem battle scene context except fight freedom dont get wrong duel hardly original either fact probably time many film duel battle scene context duel cunningham rob roy beauty behold one greatest scene film history let explain first fighting style bearing two character duel describe character perfectly cunningham effette dangerous rob roy strong courageous cunningham us fencing sword rob us broadsword cunningham fight quick tricky movement roys fighting style obvious whole film deliberately slow first half exciting second half leading moment powerful stuff clear rob must exterminate menacing evil plagued whole world rob finally get upper hand literally figuratively one greatest moment film history rob win live honor powerful cunningham use music absolutely chilling scene good prevailing real evil powerful seeing dude get disemboweled yell freedom hey maybe thats rob roy realistic braveheart dont know people aristocracy scotsman talked like people rob roy feel clearly attempt capture speech pattern feel many people bored rob roy simply cant understand character saying case read shakesphere put closecaptioning rob roy actually one greatest written film many dialogue film clever maybe watch film couple time understand contrast dialogue braveheart hardly interesting course expect main character scotsman played australian legend clearly attempt capture speech time film take place several century rob roy yet talk like people today thus reason many people like better audience today become increasingly lazy dont want take time patience understand thing complex therefore many epic film expect see villians speak recognizable english accent hero speak vernacular far away american language sure clear wallace scotish sounding like scotty star trek couple ayes acknowledgement scot film fit hollywood tradition believe scot sound description prove rob roy better film braveheart hardly prof one thing show hardly common knowledge braveheart better film rob roy put simply rob roy film theme apropos today world braveheart film legend inspiring hardly realistic make decision
